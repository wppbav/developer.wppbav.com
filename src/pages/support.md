# Help & Support

If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions about using it, please do reach out to us.
We are happy to help.

Please also reach out if you are struggling with how to use the BAV dataset, or how best to use the endpoints. We are
more than happy to help you on the right track, and to extend the API to be more efficient and useful. What's more
useful for you is more useful for us, and likely for everyone across the group as well.

Please reach out to our technical support at [support@bernskiold.com](mailto:support@bernskiold.com).

The API is maintained for BAV@WPP by [Bernskiold](https://bernskiold.com).
