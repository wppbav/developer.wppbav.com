Back in May we were one of the first to announce support for the Model Control Protocol (MCP) with our BAV MCP server.
Since then it has been used across agents and AI models to push the boundaries of analysis that can be done with BAV
data, as well as serving as the foundation of integration with other datasets.

We've also been fortunate to hear from many of you about your experiences using the MCP server, and what new tools
and capabilities you'd like to see.

Today, we're excited to announce the next generation of our BAV MCP server.

The new version brings several enhancements:

- **Improved Filter Understanding**: When requesting data the system now better understands natural language filters and
  makes better assumptions for wide queries.
- **Expanded Metadata**: The MCP server now supports a range of important metadata, such as brand coverage, studies,
  audiences and more.
- **More datasets**: In addition to BAV, the MCP server now supports a range of additional datasets including Best
  Countries and Financial Data.

It also sets the stage for future enhancements and capabilities coming soon.

We're excited to see how you'll leverage the new capabilities of the BAV MCP server in your projects. As always, we
welcome your feedback and look forward to hearing about the innovative ways you're using BAV data.
