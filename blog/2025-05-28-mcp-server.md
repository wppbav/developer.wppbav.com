Your AI models and agents can now use the official BAV MCP server to access BAV data in both a simple and secure way. An
MCP server is a convenient way to connect your AI models and agents to external data sources, such as BAV. The server
offers a set of tools that agents can trigger to get the data they need to then process and use in their tasks.

Our new remote MCP server uses the latest MCP (Model Control Protocol) standard.

We're excited to see how you and your agents use BAV data to power your workflows. If you have questions, feedback, or
requests for new MCP tools, please let us know.
