All of the BAV Archetype ranks and scores have been available directly through
the [Brandscape Data](/docs/2.x/core-resources/brandscape-data) endpoint. The new Archetypes Tools API endpoint offers a
more convenient way of accessing the Archetypes data.

It also adds support for getting the "Competitive Archetype" data, which is not available through the Brandscape Data
endpoint. Archetypes are divided between the "Cultural Archetype" (against all brands in a study) and the "Competitive
Archetype" (against a competitive set). The competitive set can be defined as either a collection or a category.

All the querying details are available in the [Archetypes API](/docs/2.x/tools/archetypes)
documentation in the Tools / TurboPitch section.
