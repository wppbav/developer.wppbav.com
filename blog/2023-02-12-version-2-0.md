We are excited to release the second version of the API which includes a number of new features and improvements. Thank
you to everyone who have provided feedback and suggestions for improvements.

With the new version we aim to make a series of breaking changes that are only possible with a new version of the API.
They will allow us to better add continuous improvements and new features regularly without having to release new
breaking-change versions.

We suggest that you review all calls and responses for any changes to the responses.

At a high-level, these are the changes that will affect you:

- There are no removed resources but several new ones.
- Some fields have been given new names, a select few have been removed.
- Filtering now has a new, consistent format (see [filtering](/docs/2.x/customizing/filters)).
- Sorting now has a new, simplified format (see [sorting](/docs/2.x/customizing/filters)).
- Expansions are now includes (see [includes](/docs/2.x/customizing/includes)).
- Ability to scope API keys to specific operations.

If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,
please [do reach out to us](mailto:support@bernskiold.com). We are happy to help.
