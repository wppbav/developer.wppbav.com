            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to release the second version of the API which includes a number of new features and improvements. Thank
you to everyone who have provided feedback and suggestions for improvements.</p><p>With the new version we aim to make a series of breaking changes that are only possible with a new version of the API.
They will allow us to better add continuous improvements and new features regularly without having to release new
breaking-change versions.</p><p>We suggest that you review all calls and responses for any changes to the responses.</p><p>At a high-level, these are the changes that will affect you:</p><ul><li>There are no removed resources but several new ones.</li><li>Some fields have been given new names, a select few have been removed.</li><li>Filtering now has a new, consistent format (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/filters">filtering</a>).</li><li>Sorting now has a new, simplified format (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/filters">sorting</a>).</li><li>Expansions are now includes (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/includes">includes</a>).</li><li>Ability to scope API keys to specific operations.</li></ul><p>If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,
please <a href="mailto:support@bernskioldmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do reach out to us</a>. We are happy to help.</p>]]></content:encoded>
