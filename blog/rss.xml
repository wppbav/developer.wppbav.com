            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some of the data that we track, we need to map it to a city. For this reason we maintain a database of cities in the
world with a population over 500 people, based on the <a href="https://www.geonames.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoNames</a> database.</p><p>We have now made this database available through the API. You can find the documentation for the new endpoint in the
<a href="/docs/2.x/core-resources/cities">API reference</a>.</p><p>The cities endpoint comes with a few filters that you can use to narrow down the results. For example, you can filter
by country or region, or for example retrieve capitals only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are happy to announce the release of our new Python SDK. We use Python scripts quite heavily at BAV and the SDK is a
result of our own needs. We hope that it will be useful for others as well.</p><p>By using the Python SDK you can easily integrate your Python scripts with BAV without having to spend time creating the
necessary API connection overhead.</p><p>The SDK is available on GitHub and has been created by Ignacio Maiz at BAV. If you'd like to contribute, we hare more
than happy for contributions to the SDK over at
GitHub.</p><p>The <a href="/docs/2.x/developer-tools/python">developer tools section</a> has more information on how to get started with the SDK.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While the API has always contained the ability to fetch all the Brandscape Data values, a lot of the time you only need
a subset of data in a specific way. This is the philosophy behind the suite of TurboPitch endpoints which are already
available in The Fount for you to use.</p><p>Today we are opening up the use of these to the API as well, so that you can get the data programatically
in the same way as you can graphically in The Fount.</p><p>The new endpoints are available for most of the TurboPitch tools. If one that you need isn't yet available, please reach
out to us, and we are happy to add it for you.</p><p>If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,
please <a href="mailto:support@bernskioldmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do reach out to us</a>. We are happy to help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="/docs/2.x/core-resources/brandscape-data">Brandscape Data</a> endpoint has been extended with details and filtering based on two new relationships: Sector and Company.</p><p>The sector is a higher-level grouping of categories to create larger groups of brands. Whereas categories can vary greatly between markets, sectors stay consitent. This makes them perfect for cross-market and cross-year analysis.</p><p>The company is the legal entity that owns a given brand. One company can own many brands. Through the company you can tie together financial performance such as annual results or stock price details with the brandscape data.</p><p>Both are available now as includes in the brandscape data endpoint. This means that for each brandscape data record you can get the company and sector details along with all other data.</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Include the company</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">GET /api/v2/brandscape-data/?include</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain">company</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Include the sector</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">GET /api/v2/brandscape-data/?include</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain">company</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Both of them are also available to filter by so that you can get the brandscape data for all brands in one or more sectors and/or companies:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Only include two specific companies.</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">GET /api/v2/brandscape-data/?filter</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token plain">companies</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1,2</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Only include the sector with ID 1.</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">GET /api/v2/brandscape-data/?filter</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token plain">sectors</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">1</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>You can read more in the <a href="/docs/2.x/core-resources/brandscape-data">Brandscape Data endpoint docs</a>.</p><p>If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to release the second version of the API which includes a number of new features and improvements. Thank
you to everyone who have provided feedback and suggestions for improvements.</p><p>With the new version we aim to make a series of breaking changes that are only possible with a new version of the API.
They will allow us to better add continuous improvements and new features regularly without having to release new
breaking-change versions.</p><p>We suggest that you review all calls and responses for any changes to the responses.</p><p>At a high-level, these are the changes that will affect you:</p><ul><li>There are no removed resources but several new ones.</li><li>Some fields have been given new names, a select few have been removed.</li><li>Filtering now has a new, consistent format (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/filters">filtering</a>).</li><li>Sorting now has a new, simplified format (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/filters">sorting</a>).</li><li>Expansions are now includes (see <a href="/docs/2.x/customizing/includes">includes</a>).</li><li>Ability to scope API keys to specific operations.</li></ul><p>If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,
