We are happy to announce the release of our new Python SDK. We use Python scripts quite heavily at BAV and the SDK is a
result of our own needs. We hope that it will be useful for others as well.

By using the Python SDK you can easily integrate your Python scripts with BAV without having to spend time creating the
necessary API connection overhead.

The SDK is available on GitHub and has been created by Ignacio Maiz at BAV. If you'd like to contribute, we hare more
than happy for contributions to the SDK over at
GitHub.

The [developer tools section](/docs/2.x/developer-tools/python) has more information on how to get started with the SDK.
