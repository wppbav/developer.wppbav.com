We are excited to improve the BAV API with support for webhooks on key platform events. Webhooks allow you to receive HTTP push notifications for data changes in BAV. This allows you to build richer integrations on top of BAV. You could, for example, use it to react in realtime to new data being available or make audiences seamlessly available in your own systems.

Webhooks is also a crucial part of our new [Audience Export](https://developer.wppbav.com/docs/2.x/audience-export). They are also a core part of upcoming enhancements to allowing other applications to integrate tightly with BAV. Being able to share more data across systems means more convenience for end users and a greater improvement to daily workflows.

Take a look at the [comphrehensive webhooks documentation](https://developer.wppbav.com/docs/2.x/webhooks) with code examples and recommendations to how best to get started with and implement webhooks.
