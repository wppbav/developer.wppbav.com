:tada: We are excited to announce the release of the `v1.0` (stable) version of the BAV Python SDK!

The latest version of the SDK includes new supported endpoints, new features and many bug fixes.

To update to the latest version of the BAV Python SDK, run the following command:

```shell
pip install --upgrade wpp-bavapi
```

:::tip Issues and feature requests
If you encounter any bugs while using the SDK, or if you have any suggestions/requests for new features, we encourage you to open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/wppbav/bavapi-sdk-python/issues/new/choose).

Some highlights since our last announcement:

- :tada: Full support for many more [endpoints](../docs/2.x/developer-tools/python/endpoints), and more [versatility](../docs/2.x/developer-tools/python/basic-usage#using-query-objects) for performing endpoint requests.
- :rocket: `bavapi` queries should now be faster and more reliable, thanks to various improvements in the requests and response parsing logic.
- :sparkles: New [error handling](../docs/2.x/developer-tools/python/basic-usage#error-handling) behavior. If a page fails to download, `bavapi` will now warn the user about the missing pages instead of raising an exception. You can change this by using `on_errors="raise"` in endpoint calls.
- :notebook: Improved [SDK documentation](../docs/2.x/developer-tools/python) and updated with the latest features and functionality.
- :bug: Fixed various issues with validation, data parsing and pagination.
