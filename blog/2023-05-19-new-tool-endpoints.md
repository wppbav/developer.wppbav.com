While the API has always contained the ability to fetch all the Brandscape Data values, a lot of the time you only need
a subset of data in a specific way. This is the philosophy behind the suite of TurboPitch endpoints which are already
available in The Fount for you to use.

Today we are opening up the use of these to the API as well, so that you can get the data programatically
in the same way as you can graphically in The Fount.

The new endpoints are available for most of the TurboPitch tools. If one that you need isn't yet available, please reach
out to us, and we are happy to add it for you.

If you are having problems with using the API, or if you have any questions or feedback,
please [do reach out to us](mailto:support@bernskioldmedia.com). We are happy to help.
