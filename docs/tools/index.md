# Overview

While the core of BAV is the [brandscape data](/core-resources/brandscape-data.md) and the metrics within, the metrics are
often used in specific ways. Either by combining a set of metrics together to tell a specific story, or to do some
further mathematical work on the data to arrive at new insights. This is what each tool within BAV and its TurboPitch
suite does.

The tool endpoints in the API correspond to each TurboPitch tool that can be used in The Fount. Each response is
slightly different, based on the data. The data returned includes, where applicable, brandscape data, calculated data
and all relevant wording.

Each endpoint documentation will show you which parameters each endpoint takes and what the response will look like.
However, we suggest that you also try each tool in the graphical interface on The Fount to get a better understanding of
the results.
