# BAV in an Agentic World

At WPP BAV we are committed to building the infrastructure to support the next generation of applications powered by AI.
Our goal is to create a platform that empowers developers across the group to come up with innovative solutions that
leverage the power of AI through our bespoke data and models.

A new era requires new tools. While our existing API is great, we recognize that it may not be the best fit for
all agentic applications. That's why we are committed to improving it and making it suitable for the next
generation of use cases.

If you are building an AI application and using our APIs, don't hesitate to reach out so that we can
collaborate on improvements and additions that will benefit the entire group.

## BAV Agents

Our BAV agents powered by Creative Studio and WPP Open enable you to easily integrate BAV data into your own agent
workflows. This offers a quick way to leverage BAV expertise and insights without the overhead of managing requests to
an MCP server.

You can use the agents standalone or as part of a larger agentic team.
