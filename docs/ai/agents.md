# BAV Agents

BAV Agents are specialized AI agents designed to assist users in various tasks by leveraging advanced natural language
processing capabilities. These agents can understand user queries, provide relevant information, and perform actions
based on user instructions.

## WPP Open & Creative Studio

Our set of pre-made BAV agents are available in WPP Open & Creative Studio. These agents can be run standalone or be
combined into more complex workflows and other data sources to create powerful AI-driven analysis.

Our core agent, the BAV Brand Brain, is a free chat agent that allows users to interact with the BAV dataset in a
natural language format. Users can ask questions about brand performance, consumer insights, and market trends, and
receive detailed responses based on the BAV data.

In addition to the BAV Brand Brain, we offer a variety of specialized agents that focus on specific aspects of brand
analysis. These agents can help users with tasks such as competitive analysis, consumer sentiment analysis, and
market segmentation.

Please [get in touch with us](mailto:bavsupport@wpp.com) for access to these agents.
