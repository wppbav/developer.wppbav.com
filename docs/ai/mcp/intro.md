# Introduction

By using an MCP server you can connect your AI models and agents directly to BAV data. This allows your agents to
retrieve up-to-date information from BAV and use it to answer user queries, generate insights, and power your workflows.

MCP (Model Control Protocol) is a standard protocol that allows AI models and agents to interact with external data
sources through a set of defined tools. Think of it as an API but specifically designed for AI models and agents to call
tools to retrieve data.

We're excited to see how you and your agents use BAV data to power your workflows. If you have questions, feedback, or
requests for new MCP tools, please let us know.

## Our MCP Servers

We currently offer a few different MCP servers that you can connect to depending on which dataset you want to access.
Please refer to each server's documentation for more details on the available tools.

## Building an internal tool?

Getting started with the BAV MCP server has a little learning curve in familiarizing yourself with BAV data, concepts
and methodology to make the most out of it. If you are building an internal tool to release to the group, please do [get
in touch with us](mailto:bavsupport@wpp.com) for assistance and collaboration.

## Issues and Feedback

If you encounter any issues while using the MCP servers or have suggestions for improvements, please reach out to us.
The AI development speed is rapid and we are continuously working to enhance our MCP offerings as new capabilities are
possible.

Your needs and feedback are invaluable in helping us prioritize our development efforts. We look forward to hearing from
you!
