# WPP Open

All of the BAV MCP Servers are available in WPP Open via Creative Studio and its agent builder.

This allows you to build agents that can access the BAV MCP servers directly from within WPP Open,
and leverage the capabilities of the agent builder to create custom workflows and integrations.

To get started with using the BAV MCP servers in WPP Open, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your WPP Open account and navigate to Creative Studio.
2. Open your playground or one of your existing projects.
3. Create a new agent or open an existing one in the Agent Builder.
4. In the Instructions tab, open Tools & Settings and find the server you want in the Tools list.

And that's it! You can now use the MCP servers in your WPP Open agents to enhance their capabilities and create more
powerful workflows.

## Using pre-built agents

Getting started with the BAV MCP server has a little learning curve in familiarizing yourself with BAV data, concepts
and methodology to make the most out of it. If you are building an internal tool, please do get in touch with us for
assistance.

To help you get started quickly, we have created some pre-built agents that create summaries and reports using key BAV
data. These can be helpful to drop in as part of a multi-step agent workflow. They are manged by BAV and makes it
super-simple for you to get started with BAV data with minimal setup.
