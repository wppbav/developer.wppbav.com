# Introduction

The Fount has a modern REST API available for consuming data through external systems. Most of the system's data can be
accessed and we have made it a priority to make access as simple as possible.

To use the API you need to have an access token. Please see the [authentication section](./authentication.md) for more
information on how to get one.
