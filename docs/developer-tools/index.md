# Developer Tools and SDKs

Libraries and tools for interacting with your BAV API integration.

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to work with the BAV API. With SDKs we take care of the heavy lifting for
you, so you can spend more time building your integration.

Since BAV is an internal WPP product we don't have a dedicated team to build and maintain SDKs. Instead we rely on the
WPP community to help maintain SDKs for languages that they write in. By sharing the load we can ensure that the SDKs
are maintained and up to date, while saving time and effort for everyone.

:::note
The collection of SDKs here are driven by community need and development. If you have done an integration with a
language we don't yet have an SDK for and would consider packaging it as an SDK and sharing, please let us know.

## Python SDK
