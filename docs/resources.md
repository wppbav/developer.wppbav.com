# Resources

To help you work with the API we have collections available for both Swagger and Postman which you can download below:

- [Postman Collection](/collections/bav-api-postman.json)
- [Swagger Definition](/collections/bav-api-swagger.json)

*(right-click and select to download the file to your computer)*

:::note Do you have an SDK?
If you have integrated the API into your own software and would like to share it with the WPP community, please let us
know and we will add it to this page. We'd love to make SDKs available for as many languages as possible.
